# Release notes

Each release is a `v*` tag on GitHub ([releases](https://github.com/imikerussell/beebots/releases)). The tag publishes
the `:latest` images that installs pull; see the README's "Updating".

## v2026.10.14: Gemini 4 Argon

Run your bees on Google's Gemini 4 Argon, on the trading rules Argon rewrote. Existing Jev installs keep working.

**Updating from an earlier release:** this release changes `docker-compose.yml` as well as the images. Pulling the
images alone is not enough if you set the Gemini key in Docker Manager or your shell: fetch the release's compose file
too (README, "Updating"), then `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d`.

- **Chooser.** With a Gemini key (from `.env` or Setup) the bees ask Gemini 4 Argon (`gemini-4-argon`) to pick their
  moves; with only a Jev key they ask Jev, as before. With no key, on paper or demo, a deterministic code chooser picks.
  Live trading still refuses to start without a model key.
- **Who decided, every time.** Each decision records, streams and shows who actually made it: the model, the code
  chooser (with the reason: no key, cap reached, a call refused because it could pass the cap, backoff, timeout, error,
  an answer off the menu, or a paced hold), or the rules. Code's calls are tagged **CODE** in the decision stream and
  show no model confidence, and the header says when code is standing in, including near the cap. The badge names the
  configured chooser only.
- **The code chooser does not read your bees' free-text rules.** It picks from the style's menu by fixed priorities.
  Coin limits and the risk layer still apply. The README says so before you rely on custom rules.
- **Gemini spend cap.** Before each call the engine reserves the call's worst case (prompt bound plus the full answer
  budget) against today's spend plus every call in flight, and writes it to the database first, so concurrent bees and
  a restart cannot overspend the count. Calls with unknown billing are counted at their worst case. Default $3 a day,
  priced at Argon's full rates ($4 / $20 per million tokens); each bee asks at most once a minute.
- **Prices are checked.** The engine refuses to start with a Gemini price (or, when Jev is in use, a Jev price) of 0 or
  less, or not a number; the error names the setting, never its value.
- **Jev's cap is a soft threshold,** and is now described that way. Jev calls also reserve an estimate in the database
  before they are sent, so concurrent bees and restarts count them, but Jev bills by its own token count, so calls in
  flight can take a day somewhat over the threshold.
- **Strategies.** Argon's rewrite of all three styles (`strategies/`): no style is forced into a trade any more,
  Breakout covers 8 majors, and the defaults, `.env.example` and the Beekeeper's playbook follow.
- **Exits never wait for a model.** Stops, time stops, the daily loss stop and retirement run on their own exit watch;
  a per-bee order lock stops the watch and the tick from sending two orders for one bee.
- **Setup** has a "Who makes the calls" step: a Gemini key by default, or **Use Jev instead**. The Gemini key check
  shares the per-visitor request cap with the other checks.
- **Effective config.** `effective-config --runtime`, run inside the engine container, shows the settings the running
  engine actually uses (keys as present or absent only). The file form is labelled a simulation: it cannot see settings
  set outside the file.
- **Dashboard.** "Powered by Gemini 4 Argon" badge, chooser-named labels, and the equity chart no longer overflows on a
  long curve.
